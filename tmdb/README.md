# TMDB Scripts

All scripts here are used to interact with the [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started).

Before using the scripts, export your TMDB authentication token as an environment variable. 
This token is used in the authentication bearer header for all requests:

```bash
export TMDB_AUTH_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```
